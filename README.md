### üëã Hi, I'm Maria Nikitha Suresh

I'm a data scientist passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and solutions. I recently earned my Master‚Äôs in Data Science from the University of Arizona, where I explored everything from predictive modeling in healthcare to generative AI for preserving traditional Indian embroidery art.

My projects blend technical depth with human-centered thinking ‚Äî from interactive dashboards and time series analyses to machine learning models that create cultural impact.
